        <p>
            Reach The Peak is a 2D, top-down, (singleplayer and/or) online multiplayer Co-op game where you are stuck in an Dungeon.
            Collect skill books that grant you offensive, defensive, and utility skills to enhance your chances of survival.
            As you progress, you’ll need to grow stronger to venture deeper into the abyss and ultimately reach the peak of your
            abilities to escape the labyrinth of dungeons!
        </p>

        <h3>About the Game</h3>

        <p>
            This was my first passion project where I've spend a lot of time on, but unfortunaly underestimated the project's size, mostly because of the multiplayer aspect.
            I do intend to work on this in the future but for now I want to focus on something smaller.
            The reason I'm keeping it on my website is because I did gain a lot of experience and enjoyment making this game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also keep in mind I'm a programmer, so creating visually appealing designs isn’t my strong suit, but I did my best. :)
        </p>

        <p>
            The gameplay is limited, but most core mechanics are implemented.
        </p>

        <h4>Player controller</h4>

        <p>
            The player can dash to evade enemies, attack, activate skills for offense or defense, and pick up and hold items. All of these
            features are programmed except for dashing. There’s also a leveling system—players absorb essence from defeated monsters to
            gain levels. Skills can further boost stats, providing additional ways to strengthen characters.

        </p>

        <h4>Skills</h4>

        <p>
            Skills can be <span class="highlight">active</span> or <span class="highlight"> passive </span>.
            Active skills allow specific actions, like attacking with a sword or conjuring a stone wall
            for defense. Passive skills, in contrast, improve stats based on certain actions, such as defeating enemies
            for combat passives or blocking for defensive passives.

            </ul>

        <p>
            To gather skills, players must find skill books, which vary in quality and usefulness.

        <h4 id="">Inventory And Item system</h4>

        <p>
            An inventory and item system is in place, though currently there are only a few items—a sword, some tools, and skill books.
            The item system is designed for scalability, allowing for easy addition of future items like different swords, armor,
            and crafting materials.

        <h4 id="">Online Cooperative Multiplayer</h4>

        <p>
            When I began this project, I underestimated the difficulty of making a multiplayer game. However, with the
            <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/">"Netcode for GameObject" </a> package in Unity,
            all current features are now functional in multiplayer. Players can connect through a code generated by Unity Cloud Relay
            service, one friend hosts the game and shares their code for others to join.
        </p>


        <div id="saveLoad"></div>

        <hr class="empty-divider">


        <h4 id="">Saving and Loading</h4>

        <p>
            This feature is also functional, using JSON to save inventory, skills, skill levels, and player stats and with the possibility of having multiple character slots.
            All of this will also be loaded for other players in multiplayer.
        </p>


        <div id="enemies"></div>


        <hr class="empty-divider">



        <h4>Enemies</h4>

        <p>
            A basic state machine is set up with several states to initiate AI behavior, though more development is
            needed to fully flesh out enemy AI. I plan to start with three enemy types but aim to add more over time.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="highlight"> > Small Cyclops</span></h5>

        <p>
            The first enemy players encounter—a young cyclops with a stick, intent on hitting and eating anything that moves.
            Its movement and attack patterns are simple.
        </p>

        <div class="gif-container small-gif">

        </div>

        <h5><span class="highlight"> > Red Glareling</span></h5>

        <p>
            This little red ball has laser eyes and attacks from a distance, retreating if players get too close.
        </p>

        <div class="gif-container small-gif">
            <img src="../Images/ReachThePeak/RedGlareling.gif" />
        </div>

        <h5><span class="highlight"> > Big Cyclops</span></h5>

        <p>
            Once players have defeated enough young cyclopes, their older, faster, and stronger siblings will appear
        </p>

        <h4 id="">Simple Procedural Dungeon Generation</h4>

        <p>
            I have no experience in procedural generation and aim to develop an endless dungeon that grows more challenging as players
            progress, but since I work on this alone, I don't have the time to do this yet. So, I’m using the
            <a href="https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/Edgar-Unity">Edgar Package</a>, with plans to implement my own generator in the future.
            While Edgar provides a solid foundation, adjustments will need to be made.
